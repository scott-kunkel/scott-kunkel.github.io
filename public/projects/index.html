<p>The modern factory farming industry is one of the most ethically troubling issues of the present day, not only for its consequences for animal welfare but also its detrimental impact on the environment. Despite an increasing amount of research on how awareness of such issues leads to downstream changes in dietary choice, very little work has looked at how <em>linguistic</em> variation may shape receptivity to and, relatedly, efficacy of animal rights messaging.</p>
<p>As a first step in examining this question, I am working with Céline Pozniak (<em>Structures Formelles du Langage</em>, Paris) to explore <strong>how variation between active and passive voice in descriptions of ethically questionnable factory farming practices influence the moral evaluation of such acts</strong>. Given that the passive voice typically conveys a greater sense of objectivity than the active voice and can therefore increase readers’ psychological distance from the contents of a message, we predict that practices described in the passive voice will be judged as less ethically problematic than those described in the active voice. This study fits within the broader field of <strong>ecolinguistics</strong>, which seeks to shed light on how language shapes our relationship with other living organisms.</p>
