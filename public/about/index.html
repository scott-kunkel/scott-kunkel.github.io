<meta name="description" content="Hi, I&rsquo;m Scott (he/him) ✋
I&rsquo;m currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Konstanz. Before that, I completed my doctoral studies at Queen Mary University of London (2021-2025), my master&rsquo;s studies at Indiana University (2018-2021), and my bachelor&rsquo;s studies at the University of Georgia (2012-2017).
My work sits at the intersection of sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and social psychology. In my research, I primarily use experimental methods to better understand the ways in which sociolinguistic variation is represented in the mind, as well as the perceptual and behavioral outcomes of these representations. I draw on a range of innovative, quantitative approaches in my work, including eye tracking, social-cuing paradigms in speech perception, and implicit-stereotype priming. Much of my work focuses on accent perception and phonetic variation, particularly across varieties of French and English.

<p>I&rsquo;m currently a <strong>postdoctoral researcher</strong> at the University of Konstanz. Before that, I completed my doctoral studies at Queen Mary University of London (2021-2025), my master&rsquo;s studies at Indiana University (2018-2021), and my bachelor&rsquo;s studies at the University of Georgia (2012-2017).</p>
<p>My work sits at the intersection of <strong>sociolinguistics</strong>, <strong>psycholinguistics</strong>, and <strong>social psychology</strong>. In my research, I primarily use <strong>experimental methods</strong> to better understand the ways in which sociolinguistic variation is represented in the mind, as well as the perceptual and behavioral outcomes of these representations. I draw on a range of innovative, quantitative approaches in my work, including eye tracking, social-cuing paradigms in speech perception, and implicit-stereotype priming. Much of my work focuses on <strong>accent perception and phonetic variation</strong>, particularly across varieties of French and English.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m increasingly interested in ways that linguistics can be used to reveal and help rectify societal inequalities. I&rsquo;m a firm advocate for open science practices and for making research as accessible and inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>🌱 Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, cooking, reading about ethics and anarchism, and listening to music (I&rsquo;m particularly fond of ambient music).</p>
