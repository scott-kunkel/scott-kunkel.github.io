<meta name="description" content="Hi, I&rsquo;m Scott (he/him).
I received my PhD in Linguistics from Queen Mary University of London (2025). I previously earned my master’s degree from Indiana University (2021) and my bachelor’s degree from the University of Georgia (2017). In 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Konstanz.
My work sits at the intersection of variationist sociolinguistics, phonetics, and psycholinguistics. I use a range of quantitative methods to understand how socially meaningful variation is represented in the mind and how these representations shape perception and linguistic behavior. My current work focuses on cross-dialectal variation and accent perception, particularly across varieties of French and English, with an emphasis on experimentally modeling socially conditioned variation.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>I received my PhD in Linguistics from Queen Mary University of London (2025). I previously earned my master’s degree from Indiana University (2021) and my bachelor’s degree from the University of Georgia (2017). In 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Konstanz.</p>
<p>My work sits at the intersection of <strong>variationist sociolinguistics</strong>, <strong>phonetics</strong>, and <strong>psycholinguistics</strong>. I use a range of quantitative methods to understand how socially meaningful variation is represented in the mind and how these representations shape perception and linguistic behavior. My current work focuses on cross-dialectal variation and accent perception, particularly across varieties of French and English, with an emphasis on experimentally modeling socially conditioned variation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in ways that linguistics can be used to reveal and help rectify societal inequalities. I am also a strong advocate for open science practices and for making research as accessible and inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>🌱 Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, cooking vegan recipes, reading fiction, playing the drums, and listening to ambient music.</p>
