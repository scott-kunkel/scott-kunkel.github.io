Hi, I'm Scott (he/him) ✋

<div style="text-align: justify;">

I'm currently a **postdoctoral researcher** at University of Konstanz. Before that, I completed my doctoral studies at Queen Mary University of London (2021-2025), my master's studies at Indiana University (2018-2021), and my bachelor's studies at the University of Georgia (2012-2017). 

My work sits at the intersection of **sociolinguistics**, **psycholinguistics**, and **social psychology**. In my research, I primarily use **experimental methods** to better understand the ways in which sociolinguistic variation is represented in the mind, as well as the perceptual and behavioral outcomes of these representations. I draw on a range of quantitative approaches in my work, including eye tracking, social-cuing paradigms in speech perception, and implicit-stereotype priming. Much of my work has focused on **accent perception and phonetic variation**, particularly across varieties of French and English.

I'm increasingly interested in ways that linguistics can be used to reveal and help rectify societal inequalities. I'm a firm advocate for open science practices and for making research as accessible and inclusive as possible.

🌱 Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, cooking, reading about ethics and anarchism, and listening to music (I'm particularly fond of ambient music).
