Hi, I'm Scott (he/him) ✋

<div style="text-align: justify;">

I'm currently a **postdoctoral researcher** at University of Konstanz (from February 2025). Before that, I did my doctoral studies at Queen Mary University of London (2021-2025), my master's studies at Indiana University (2018-2021), and my bachelor's studies at the University of Georgia (2012-2017). 

My work straddles the boundaries between **sociolinguistics**, **psycholinguistics**, and **social psychology**. In my research, I primarily use **experimental methods** to better understand the ways in which sociolinguistic variation is represented in the mind, as well as the perceptual and behavioral outcomes of these representations. Much of my work has focused on accent perception and phonetic variation.

I'm increasingly interested in ways that linguistics can be used to reveal and help rectify societal inequalities. I'm a firm advocate for open science practices and for making research as accessible and inclusive as possible.

🌱 Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, cooking, reading about ethics and anarchism, and listening to music (I'm a big fan of ambient music).
