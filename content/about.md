Hi, I'm Scott (he/him) âœ‹

<div style="text-align: justify;">

I'm currently a **postdoctoral researcher** at University of Konstanz (from February 2025). Before that, I did a PhD at Queen Mary University of London (2021-2025).

My work straddles the boundaries between **sociolinguistics**, **psycholinguistics**, and **social psychology**. In my research, I primarily use **experimental methods** to better understand the ways in which sociolinguistic variation is represented in the mind, as well as the perceptual and behavioral outcomes of these representations.

I'm increasingly interested in ways that linguistics can be used to reveal and help rectify societal inequalities. I'm a firm advocate for open science practices and for making research as accessible and inclusive as possible.

ðŸŒ± Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, cooking tasty vegan food, reading about ethics and anarchism, and listening to music (my tastes typically vacillate between ambient and black metal).
