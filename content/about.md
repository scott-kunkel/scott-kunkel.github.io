Hi, I'm Scott (he/him).

<div style="text-align: justify;">

I received my PhD in Linguistics from Queen Mary University of London (2025). I previously earned my master’s degrees from Indiana University (2020, 2021) and my bachelor’s degree from the University of Georgia (2017). In 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Konstanz. 

My work sits at the intersection of **variationist sociolinguistics**, **phonetics**, and **psycholinguistics**. I use a range of quantitative methods to understand how socially meaningful variation is represented in the mind and how these representations shape perception and linguistic behavior. My current work focuses on cross-dialectal variation and accent perception, particularly across varieties of French and English, with an emphasis on experimentally modeling socially conditioned variation.

I'm interested in ways that linguistics can be used to reveal and help rectify societal inequalities. I am also a strong advocate for open science practices and for making research as accessible and inclusive as possible.

🌱 Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, cooking vegan recipes, reading fiction, playing the drums, and listening to ambient music.
