title: "A bit about me"

Hi, I'm Scott (he/him) 

<div style="text-align: justify;">

I'm currently a **postdoctoral researcher** at University of Konstanz (from February 2025). Before that, I did a PhD at Queen Mary University of London (2021-2025).

My work straddles the boundaries between **sociolinguistics**, **psycholinguistics**, and **social psychology**. In my research, I primarily use **experimental methods** to better understand the ways in which sociolinguistic variation is represented in the mind. 

I'm increasingly interested in ways that linguistics can be used to uncover and help in rectifying societal inequalities.

I'm a firm believer in **open science practices** and in keeping research as accessible and inclusive as possible.

ðŸŒ± Aside from research, I enjoy hiking, vegan cooking, reading anarchist philosophy, and listening to music (my tastes usually vacillate between ambient and sludge metal).
