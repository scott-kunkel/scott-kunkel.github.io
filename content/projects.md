## Social and cognitive mechanisms of accent-based hiring bias

Foreign- or nonstandard-accented individuals are typically evaluated less positively in terms of hirability compared to native- or standard-accented speakers with the same qualifications. Despite decades of experimental work on **accent-based hiring bias**, significant gaps remain that limit the applicability of this research to real-life recruitment contexts. In current research, I am interested in exploring two of these gaps:

1. The first relates to **how individuals form impressions of marginalized job candidates**. As most studies on accent-based bias have relied solely on speech recordings in testing this phenomenon, little is know about how **intersectional** sociolinguistic cues influence hiring outcomes. I am particularly interested in how *accent*, *gender*, and *ethnicity* interact in shaping the perceived hirability of job candidates.

2. The second gap relates to **what can be done to mitigate accent-based hiring bias**. Although a multitude of studies have pointed to accent as a source of discrimination in the job market, very few have systematically tested the efficacy of **interventions against accent bias**. In my research, I am interested in comparing the efficacy of *affective*, *behavioral*, and *cognitive* interventions in reducing bias and increasing opportunities for underrepresented candidates.   

## Language variation in animal rights advocacy

The modern factory farming industry is one of the most ethically troubling issues we face today, not only given its consequences for animal welfare but also its detrimental impact on the environment. Despite an increasing amount of research on how awareness of such issues leads to downstream changes in dietary choice, very little work has looked at how *linguistic* variation shapes receptivity to animal rights messaging.

As a first step in examining this question, I am working with [Céline Pozniak](https://cpozniak.github.io/) and [Yanis Da Cunha](http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/fr/Gens/Da-Cunha)to explore **how variation between active and passive voice in descriptions of ethically questionnable factory farming practices influence the moral evaluation of such acts**. Given that the passive voice typically conveys a greater sense of objectivity than the active voice and can therefore increase readers’ psychological distance from the contents of a message, we predict that practices described in the passive voice will be judged as less ethically problematic than those described in the active voice. This study fits within the broader field of **ecolinguistics**, which seeks to shed light on how language shapes our relationship with other living organisms.     

## Influence of intersectional social cues in political speech perception

Speech perception most often occurs in the presence of other social cues, such as visual cues about the ethnicity of a speaker. Despite this, research on the sociolinguistic perception of speakers has largely  focused on social information gleaned exclusively from linguistic cues. As a result, it remains poorly understood how differences in speech perception arise from the intersection of multimodal sociolinguistic cues. 

In my postdoctoral research at the University of Konstanz, I have explored this topic in the context of political speech. In collaboration with [Tamara Rathcke](https://tamara-rathcke.github.io/), I am currently investigating **how the confluence of accentedness (e.g., foreign vs. native), gender, and ethnicity influence speech perception and downstream judgements**, including political persuasion, perceived political agency, and gendered associations of political charisma. By uncovering how accent, gender, and ethnicity work together to shape social perception, this work contributes to a more nuanced and ecological model of impression formation in real-life communicative contexts.

## Listening effort in accented speech processing

Even when speech is correctly understood, processing effort can vary depending on a speaker’s accent. For instance, past studies show that foreign-accented speech tends to require more **processing effort** than native-accented speech to be correctly understood. In this study – conducted in collaboration with [Marc Barnard](https://www.marcbarnard.co.uk/), [Adam Chong](https://www.adamjchong.com/), and [Rémi Lamarque](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sllf/linguistics/people/academic/profiles/lamarque.html) – we tested **whether native speech in a non-local accent also incurs a higher processing cost than speech in a local, native accent**. To test this, we ran a **pupillometry study**, as increases in pupil dilation are known to index increased cognitive effort. Our results showed that regionally accented speech elicited a level of processing effort between that of local native and non-native speech. Crucially, however, this pattern varied across regional accents, suggesting that factors beyond listening effort may also influence pupil dilation during online speech processing.

I am currently working with Marc, Rémi, and [Ruohan Guo](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/90633-ruohan-guo) on a follow-up study testing **whether expectations about what accent a listener will hear affects the listening effort listeners expend when processing it** (more information [here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WYZDU)).
       
## Cross-dialect exposure and sociolinguistic representations 

In my PhD research, I studied **how long-term exposure to a second dialect (D2) of a native language influences the mental representation of dialectal sounds**. My investigation focused specifically on native French speakers who had moved between France and Quebec. To examine how cross-dialectal exposure affects different levels of the language system, I tested changes in both speech production and perception. One of the most interesting patterns I found was that individuals showed *asymmetrical change* across these domains in the degree to which they adapted to a D2: mobile speakers from France showed more adaptation toward Quebec French than mobile Quebec speakers did toward Hexagonal French (i.e., the French of France). I argue that this reflects, in part, the **asymmetrical prestige and presence** of Hexagonal French versus Quebec French.

I am currently working to expand this work on D2 acquisition in a Francophone context in collaboration with [Nadège Fournier](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nadege-Fournier-2), [Josiane Riverin-Coutlée](https://jriverincoutlee.wordpress.com/about/), and [Julie Auger](https://julieaugerudem.wordpress.com/).
