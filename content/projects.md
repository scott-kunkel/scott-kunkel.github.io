## Language variation in animal rights advocacy

The modern factory farming industry is one of the most ethically troubling issues that we face today, not only for its consequences for animal welfare but also its detrimental impact on the environment. Despite an increasing amount of research on how awareness of such issues can lead to downstream changes in dietary choice, very little work has looked at how *linguistic* variation may shape receptivity to and, relatedly, the efficacy of animal rights messaging.

As a first pass at exploring this question, I am working with Céline Pozniak (Structures Formelles du Langage, Paris) to explore how variation between active and passive voice in descriptions of ethically questionnable factory farming practices may influence the moral evaluation of this information.
